You can take inspiration from the examples of enemies below to get a sense of the type of enemy you should generate, but you may generate a new enemy as well, or a variation of one of the below enemies.

Focus on generating interesting enemies, challenging enemies, or enemies that might complement the dungeon's environment or narrative. Consider enemies that fit the player's current level and abilities, or that provide unique obstacles and opportunities for strategic combat.

Tips for Creating Balanced and Engaging Enemy Stats
  - **Align with Player Progression:**
    Ensure that enemy power scales appropriately with player levels to maintain game balance.
  
  - **Consider Threat Level and Variety:**
    Introduce a range of enemies with different challenge ratings and abilities to keep encounters diverse and engaging.
    
  - **Encourage Tactical Combat:**
    Design enemies with abilities that require strategic thinking and teamwork from players.
    
  - **Integrate Lore and Story:**
    Connect enemies to the gameâ€™s narrative, making them more meaningful and enhancing immersion.
    
  - **Balance Mechanical Benefits:**
    Weigh the enemy's offensive and defensive capabilities to ensure fair and engaging combat.
    
  - **Provide Clear Descriptions:**
    Ensure that enemy abilities and behaviors are clearly defined to avoid confusion during gameplay.
    
  - **Include Weaknesses and Resistances:**
    Adding vulnerabilities or resistances can encourage diverse strategies and interactions.

The player state is:
${JSON.stringify(player)}

Examples of monsters we can use as inspiration:
${JSON.stringify(getRandomItems(monsters, 5))}

NOTE: When generating a monster's details, focus on what distinguishes the monster from other similar creatures, even if it's slight. 
Incorporate small bonuses, drawbacks, status effects, behavioral ticks, specific emotional state, or unique lore elements that make the monster stand out. 
Be sure to mention about this specific monster:
1. current emotional state
2. current behavior, eg. is it pacing around, standing still, etc.
3. current physical state, eg. is it bleeding, injured, etc.
4. current mental state, eg. is it hallucinating, panicking, etc.
5. probably has not noticed the player yet, since it's the first time the player has encountered this monster.

Emphasize any unique behaviors, abilities, weaknesses, or mysterious traits that are specific to this particular monster. 
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT to include small details that differentiate this monster from others of its type. For common monsters, these differences might be purely visual, behavioral, or based on minor abilities, without delving into high-level magical or legendary attributes.

Generate an enemy with the following schema:
{
  "enemy": {
    "name": "string - name of the enemy",
    "description": "string - description of the enemy",
    "hiddenDetailedStats": "string - long, comma separated list of statistics that include unique abilities, minor bonuses or penalties, special traits, or slight variations in standard stats that set this monster apart.",
    "hiddenDetailedStatuses": "string - long, specific detailed description of specific conditions, behaviors, or status effects the monster can impose or is subject to, highlighting any unique interactions or tendencies.",
    "hiddenDetailedAttributes": "string - long, specific detailed description that cover rarity, habitat preferences, lore snippets, unique weaknesses or resistances, and any other distinguishing features.",
  }
}
