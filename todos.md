## dungeon master

- try to allow most actions as long as not absurd
- focus on emergent, unpredictable, and memorable experiences

- each knowledge gain is specific to a room/theme/enemy/item/etc. (needs a target)

- the dungeon master over time learns the kind of player you are and verbalizes appropriately or tiny references or inside jokes later

## technical

- use prompt caching
  - should only pass in current room and prev room
- use predicted outputs
