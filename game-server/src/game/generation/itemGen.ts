  You can take inspiration from the examples of items below to get a sense of the type of item you should generate, but you may generate a new item as well, or a variation of one of the below items.

  Focus on generating interesting items, or useful items, or items that might be useful when combined with other items in the player's inventory.
  Or items the player might use or might fit the player's playstyle or might be useful in a specific situation.
  Items should be useable based on the player's current stats and level.

  Tips for Creating Balanced and Engaging Item Stats
    Align with Character Progression:
    Ensure that item power scales appropriately with character levels to maintain game balance.

    Consider Rarity and Availability:
    Rarer items should have more potent or unique effects, making them valuable and sought after.
    
    Encourage Strategic Use:
    Design items that offer versatility or require strategic thinking, rather than providing straightforward power boosts.
    
    Integrate Lore and Story:
    Connect items to the gameâ€™s narrative, making them more meaningful and memorable for players.
    
    Balance Mechanical Benefits:
    Weigh the benefits against potential drawbacks to prevent items from becoming overpowered.
    
    Provide Clear Descriptions:
    Ensure that item effects are clearly defined to avoid confusion during gameplay.
    
    Limit Attunement Slots:
    Be mindful of the maximum number of items that require attunement to prevent characters from becoming too powerful.


  The player state is:
  ${JSON.stringify(player)}

  The type of item we want to generate is: ${itemType}

  Examples of items we can use as inspiration:

    ${itemExamples}
    
    NOTE: when generating item's hidden stats, statuses, and attributes, focus on what distinguishes the item from other similar items, even if it's slight.
    Mention if there is a small bonus, or a small drawback, or a small effect, or a small property, or a small requirement, or a small attribute, etc.
    Mention if this item has a unique effect, requirement, property, or attribute, that isn't in other items of this type.
    Mention any lore or mysterious attributes, specific to this particular item that aren't in other items of this type. This is usually in magical or higher rarity items.
    IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MENTION ANY SMALL DETAILS THAT MAKE THIS ITEM UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT FROM OTHER ITEMS OF THIS TYPE.
    For common items, sometimes there are just visual differences, or small effects, or small properties, or small requirements, or small attributes, but no lore or magical effects.
    Generate an item with the following schema:
{
  "item": {
    "name": "string - name of the item, e.g., 'Sword of Flames', 'Healing Potion'",
    "description": "string - long description of the item, detailing its appearance, effects, and lore",
    "hiddenDetailedStats": "string - long, comma separated list of the dnd 5e stats and ability scores of the item",
    "hiddenDetailedStatuses": "string - long, specific detailed description of the statuses of the item",
    "hiddenDetailedAttributes": "string - long, specific detailed description of the attributes of the item",
  }
}

The hidden detailed stats and statuses of the item may include such stats as the following. The purposes of this field is so that the LLM can "remember" the stats and statuses of the item when it is used in an action.
