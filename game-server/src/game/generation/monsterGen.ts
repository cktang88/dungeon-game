You can take inspiration from the examples of enemies below to get a sense of the type of enemy you should generate, but you may generate a new enemy as well, or a variation of one of the below enemies.

Focus on generating interesting enemies, challenging enemies, or enemies that might complement the dungeon's environment or narrative. Consider enemies that fit the player's current level and abilities, or that provide unique obstacles and opportunities for strategic combat.

NOTE: When generating a monster's details, focus on what distinguishes the monster from other similar creatures, even if it's slight. 
Incorporate small bonuses, drawbacks, status effects, behavioral ticks, specific emotional state, or unique lore elements that make the monster stand out. 
Be sure to mention about this specific monster:
1. current emotional state
2. current behavior, eg. is it pacing around, standing still, etc.
3. current physical state, eg. is it bleeding, injured, etc.
4. current mental state, eg. is it hallucinating, panicking, etc.
5. probably has not noticed the player yet, since it's the first time the player has encountered this monster.

Emphasize any unique behaviors, abilities, weaknesses, or mysterious traits that are specific to this particular monster. 
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT to include small details that differentiate this monster from others of its type. For common monsters, these differences might be purely visual, behavioral, or based on minor abilities, without delving into high-level magical or legendary attributes.

Generate an enemy with the following schema:

{
    "name": "string - name of the enemy",
    
    "description": "string - description of the enemy",
    
    "detailedStats": "A comprehensive string that includes specific and detailed statistics about the enemy. This encompasses unique physical characteristics, minor bonuses or disadvantages, special traits, or subtle variations in standard monster metrics that distinguish it from base creatures of the same type. Examples include strength, health, size, attack power, armor class, move speed, damage types, special abilities, resistances, vulnerabilities, and any other quantitative or measurable attributes that influence the enemy's interaction with adventurers. Focus on what's different about this current instance of the enemy, that DIFFERS from the base creature.",
    
    "detailedStatuses": "A detailed string that provides a detailed description of the enemy's current conditions, environmental effects, or status phenomena. This highlights unique interactions, behavioral tendencies, or ongoing effects that the enemy may have on creatures or other objects within the area. Examples include elemental properties, enchantments, auras, magical effects, behavioral patterns, environmental adaptations, or any other status-related features that create a distinct presence for the enemy. Focus on what's different about this current instance of the enemy, that DIFFERS from the base creature.",
    
    "detailedAttributes": "A detailed string that outlines additional attributes covering the enemy's materials, build quality, rarity, habitat preferences, lore snippets, unique weaknesses or resistances, and any other distinguishing features. This may include how formidable or ancient the enemy is, unique biological or magical traits, inscriptions or symbols, thematic elements, social structure, and any other characteristics that set it apart from other enemies of the same type. For higher rarity enemies, this can also encompass unique abilities, curses, blessings, or legendary backstories. Focus on what's different about this current instance of the enemy, that DIFFERS from the base creature."
