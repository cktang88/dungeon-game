You can take inspiration from the examples of enemies below to get a sense of the type of enemy you should generate, but you may generate a new enemy as well, or a variation of one of the below enemies.

Focus on generating interesting enemies, challenging enemies, or enemies that might complement the dungeon's environment or narrative. Consider enemies that fit the player's current level and abilities, or that provide unique obstacles and opportunities for strategic combat.

Tips for Creating Balanced and Engaging Enemy Stats
  - **Align with Player Progression:**
    Ensure that enemy power scales appropriately with player levels to maintain game balance.
  
  - **Consider Threat Level and Variety:**
    Introduce a range of enemies with different challenge ratings and abilities to keep encounters diverse and engaging.
    
  - **Encourage Tactical Combat:**
    Design enemies with abilities that require strategic thinking and teamwork from players.
    
  - **Integrate Lore and Story:**
    Connect enemies to the gameâ€™s narrative, making them more meaningful and enhancing immersion.
    
  - **Balance Mechanical Benefits:**
    Weigh the enemy's offensive and defensive capabilities to ensure fair and engaging combat.
    
  - **Provide Clear Descriptions:**
    Ensure that enemy abilities and behaviors are clearly defined to avoid confusion during gameplay.
    
  - **Include Weaknesses and Resistances:**
    Adding vulnerabilities or resistances can encourage diverse strategies and interactions.
